## Meissner-like effect for rotating black holes
In this topic exploration, we study the Meissner-like effect for rotating black holes.
It describes the expulsion of stationary axisymmetric magnetic fields from the outer horizon when the black hole reaches its maximum angular momentum.

## Growth and spreading of topics in arXiv.org (tentative title)
### Description: 
We aim at describing the growth and the spreading of topics in scientific papers posted on arXiv.org.
Given a keyword representing a scientific subject (e.g., entanglement, gravitational waves, etc...), we want to show the publication rate of those papers containing that keyword in a given time interval.
Next, we show how all these papers are related to each other by studying the corresponding citations: in this way we construct the graph associated to the scientific concept.
Another objective is to create a search index to chart the occurrences of (a set of) keywords in the papers on arXiv.org during a range of time.
